# Project description ü§î

Universal Containers Lawyers is a company that provides legal advisory to their customers.
**They consume data from an external system that stores the information into Heroku on a daily
basis.** They want to adopt Salesforce and need to migrate the information stored in Heroku into an org.
**The data is retrieved as a JSON, and contains two types of entities: ‚ÄòLegal Advisor‚Äô, and ‚ÄòClient‚Äô.**
There is a **web service in Heroku** that contains the json file. Also, given that this information
changes periodically, they need a way to **do this process automatically every day.**
Legal Advisors are firms that provide legal services to different clients. Clients are the ones that
hire the advisors services.
